# Microprocessor-lab  
This repo contains the files related to Microprocessor and Assembly Language Lab at AUT in Spring 2021.  
We worked with Arduino Mega 2650 in Proteus simulator and also we used Arduino IDE for codes.  
You can see the complete labs explanation in [Microlab Explanation](https://github.com/Mahdi-Rahmani/Microprocessor-lab/tree/main/Microlab%20Explanation).
The table of contents also is added below:
